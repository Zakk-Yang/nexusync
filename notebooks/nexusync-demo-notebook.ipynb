      "2. **Efficient Querying**: Use natural language to query your document collection and get relevant answers quickly.\n",
      "3. **Upsert Capability**: Easily update or insert new documents into the index without rebuilding from scratch.\n",
      "4. **Deletion Handling**: Automatically remove documents from the index when they're deleted from the filesystem.\n",
      "5. **Chat Interface**: Engage in conversational interactions with your document collection, making information retrieval more intuitive.\n",
      "6. **Flexible Embedding Options**: Choose between OpenAI and HuggingFace embedding models to suit your needs and constraints.\n",

      "* NexuSync can detect and index new or modified documents in the directory without requiring explicit updates.\n",
